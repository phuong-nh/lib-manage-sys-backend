# Fullstack project

Frontend and backend code:

- You could either copy/paste the FE code to this repo OR just keep it in the fs14-frontend/fs14-backend repository
  - If you choose to go with copy/pasting then have two folders one for client and the other for server
  - If you choose to go with continue working in the individuals then open a PR that has the links to the other repository PRs

_I would highly recommend following these steps so you would have something to show and a working project._

You should start with the backend (the idea with this step is to get it up and running with basic endpoints):

- Fix or improve the basic functionalities (Entities, Controllers, Service, etc)
- Implement a very very very very very very basic auth. Username and password with token. (NO REFRESH TOKEN or FORGOT PASSWORD) - Optional, it's fine to omit at the beginning and implement it later.

Move to the frontend:

- You refactor the basic functionalities to be consumed from your backend
  - Getting products/books
  - Fetching one book/product
  - Fetching users
  - Creating book/product/category etc..
  - Technically implement the basic endpoints your backend provides

**When finishing from the higher priorities you could start working on:**

- Broker auth with google or the basic auth if you didn't implement from the previous steps
- Improve the permission matrix
- Work on sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Other cool stuff you wanna do.

What is not basic feature:

- Sorting and Filtering.
- Pagination
- Library -> Borrowing. E-commerce -> Managing orders
- Having complex permission matrix, for instance: ADMIN can delete or add (Permissions)
- Hosting images

_You could deploy the backend before moving to the lower priority features._

Common mistakes:

- Finish all the backend and then move to frontend. (I'm not saying this bad )
- Not having a plan
- Having plan BUT you don't stick to it.
  - You could have a ticket system (use Trello)
- Spending too much time on a feature or styling and block all other tasks
  - You could simply ask in the tech channel (what is the problem and what have you done to solve it)
  - Simple, skip it.
  - Do anything but blocking your time in solving a problem that doesn't really make any huge impact or not in your interest to learn or improve
- Not being active or proactive when you have a common problem.
- Ooh I have 3 week (1_814_000 seconds), plenty of time.
